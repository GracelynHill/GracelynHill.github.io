	  <h3>Thoughts on AlphaFold</h3>
	  <h5>December 10, 2020</h5>
	  <hr/>
	  <p>Recently, there was news that shocked the bioinformatics world. Google's DeepMind Algorithm says it has 'solved' the protein folding problem. Using Deep Learning algorithms, they have developed software which is as good as experiments at predicting the structure of a protein.</p>
	  <p>Below is a graph the scientists published showing the increase in protein-folding program efficacy in the last decade.</p>

	  <p>I think this is great news, considering how expensive and time consuming protein structure prediction programs have been historically. However, I worry that since Google holds the rights to this program, it will end up being prohibitevely expensive to use for many biologists, ending us up right back where we started. Only time will tell.</p>
