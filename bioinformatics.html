      <p>I am a minor in bioinformatics at George Washington University, and I am interested in obtaining a master's degree  or PHD in the field. I have already carried out multiple interesting projects with my bioinformatics knowledge.</p>
	  <p>For my final project in my introduction to bioinformatics class, I researched genetic diversity in HIV-1 protease across different cities. I used genbank, the Stanford HIVDB program, and an R script I wrote myself to analyze nucleotide sequence data for drug resistance mutations. We found significant differences in HIV mutations across different cities. My research poster can be found below. I gave a presentation about this poster at the GWU Research Showcase.</p>

	  <p>I have also used my bioinformatics knowledge to help in the fight against COVID-19. I worked with a Lab at GW to identify new COVID-19 biomarkers as a bioinformatics curator. I used R to create charts to present that data, and one of those charts will be found in a published paper soon.</p>
	  <p>These projects illustrate that I am passionate about bioinformatics, and I look forward to applying my knowledge in the future.</p>
